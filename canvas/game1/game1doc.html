    <h1>Laser Gate Panic!</h1>
    <p>A color matching space adventure that will test your reflexes!</p>
    <h2>Story:</h2>
    <p style="width: 500px;">Roy Ark, ace pilot of the Galactic Defense Force, received a distress call while out on patrol.  Hostile forces are attacking the GDF base! The malicious Spectranoids erected a series of laser barriers to prevent Roy from returning. Luckily, Roy's ship is equipped with an anti-laser wavelength generator. As long as Roy is able to match the wavelengths of the barriers, he will pass through unharmed. Onwards, Roy!</p>
    <h2>Objective:</h2>
    <p>Squeeze through the laser openings between the barriers while matching their color. Survive as long as possible to get the highest score!</p>
    <h2>Game Screen:</h2>

    <p><b>Player: </b>This is you!<br /><b>Score: </b>The longer you survive, the higher your score!<br /><b>Laser: </b>Safe to pass through as long as you match the color!<br /><b>Barrier: </b>Avoid at all costs! Hitting this will end your game!</p>
    <h2>Controls: </h2>
    <p style="width: 500px;">Use the arrow keys to move your ship in all directions. Press the space bar to swap the color of your ship between red and blue. Either Ctrl key will pause and unpause the game.</p>
    <h2>Enhancements: </h2>
    <p style="width: 500px;">As a reminder, the original game involved guiding a rectangle between openings in an endless stream of barriers that moved towards the player.  The major change I added was implementing the color switching mechanic, so now, not only did you have to maneuver through the openings, but you also have to match the color of the opening.  I also had to program advanced collision mechanics for my non-rectangular spaceship.  There were many visual upgrades as well.  A space theme was added, with a space background, starship, and laser barriers.  The ship was animated to show rocket fire in the back.  There is a twinkling star parallax effect in the background.  The laser gates also flash and have transparency effects.  Sound elements were added as well, including background music and effects for when you move your ship, swap its color, and pass through a gate.  A pause button was programmed as well and support for arrow keys and the keyboard was programmed in.</p>
    <h2>Reflections: </h2>
    <p style="width: 500px;">Working on this project made me appreciate the existence of game engines such as Unity and Godot.  For example, in one of those engines, programming collision between non-rectangular objects is absolutely trivial.  In Canvas, it was quite the effort.  Furthermore, sprite management, transparencies, and animations are extremely easy in game engines, but not so much for Canvas.  The W3 tutorial site did not provide enough information on how the language works, so I encountered many issues with logical statements that were absolutely correct, but would just not work correctly in Canvas without a lot of extra, obtuse coding and I never knew why the original, simpler method failed.  If I had more time, I would like to add a lot more to this game, such as color-coded obstacles that must be destroyed with the appropriate colored bullets.  I could also add more colors to the game for the ship and the gates.  I would also add more visual enhancements such as an animation for the color swap and a death animation.  I would also like to rework the scoring system to make the score increase when you pass through a gate instead of being time-based.  I would further add additional math to randomize the timing of gate appearance, and implement increasing difficulty as time goes on such as gates appearing more frequently.  If I also realize there is a breakdown of object oriented programming in the code.  The "component" class covers every type of object that appears. This really should be broken down into a parent component, with children for various things such as the spaceship, barriers, sprites, etc.  I was unsure how to do this and the W3 tutorial did not offer any explanation.  The only bug I am unable to figure out is that sometimes the explosion image does not appear at game over.  Overall, this was a great struggle with many frustrations, but I am proud of the changes I was able to implement and near the end, I actually felt excited about further changes I could make.</p>
